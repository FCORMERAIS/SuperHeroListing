# Welcome to our JS Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by first year students of computer sciences. As part of our JavaScript piscine, our exam is a final project which consists in a program capable of getting the following [API]'s data (https://rawcdn.githack.com/akabab/superhero-api/0.2.0/api/all.json) in order to display it on a website.

The program can sort data by different filters (identity, powerstats, appearance, biography) which allows the user to search precisely the hero they want to find. They can also directly type some key-words (name, publisher...) in a search bar.
